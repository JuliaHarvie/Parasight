# Parasight
Kmer-based classification of Apicomplexan 18S rRNA genes

The main script that builds all the classifiers, tests them, and creates all the figures in the submission are in the file JMoggridge_Apicomplexa_classifier_notebook.Rmd (the .pdf version of the same name is just a rendered version of the script + output, embedded within the written sections of the submission)

The submitted paper is rendered from the file 'JMoggridge_parasight_pdf.Rmd' to create the pdf file 'JMoggridge_parasight_pdf.pdf'
